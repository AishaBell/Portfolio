Executive Summary<br>

Modern ransomware campaigns continue to evolve, adopting stealthier execution methods and abusing legitimate system components to evade detection. This ransomware has been operating since July, 2023, with a focus on targeting healthcare, education and technology sectors. This malware analysis documents a comprehensive static and dynamic analysis of a Windows-based ransomware sample identified as Incransom — a sophisticated malware that encrypts user data affecting the core cybersecurity CIA triad. What makes this ransomware dangerous is its ability to use Living-off-The-Land techniques and double extortion.<br>

Key Findings from Malware Investigation:<br>
•	Malware Family: INC Ransomware (Ransoware)<br>
•	Primary Target: User-data encryption and extortion<br>
•	Evasion Techniques: Process masquerading<br>
•	Persistence: Modified Startup registry key<br>

Malware Sample Acquisition<br>

The malware sample was obtained from MalwareBazaar, a reputable malware repository to ensure authenticity and research relevance. The sample was downloaded as a zip file, with its known hash value to avoid accidental acquisition of an incorrect or modified file.<br>

STATIC ANALYSIS OF INCRANSOM RANSOMWARE<br>
The malware embedded in the zip file was extracted for static malware analysis (windows.exe)<br>
1. Malware Information<br>
The windows.exe file was examined to determine its hash, format and operating system compatibility using tools Powershell, HxD and HashCalc<br>
Findings:<br>
•	Hash SHA256: 834C5F094C4A2DB0F520962341B108AF685EFD346E5B6622EB2331B3FFA09039<br>
•	File Header: MZ_ 4D 5A<br>
