My Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst Journey Portfolio<br>

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Portfolio. This repository documents my hands-on learning journey into cybersecurity, with a strong focus on malware analysis, threat intelligence, threat detection, network analysis, and vulnerability assessment.<br>

I am building practical SOC skills by working on real-world–style labs and documenting each project to reflect how security analysts investigate, detect, and respond to threats.<br>

Objective<br>

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate:<br>
• Practical SOC analyst skills<br>
• Understanding of security fundamentals and workflows<br>
• Ability to analyze alerts, traffic, and logs<br>
• Clear documentation and analytical thinking<br>

This repository will grow as I continue learning and building more advanced projects
